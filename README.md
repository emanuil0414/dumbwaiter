# dumbwaiter
The dumbwaiter is a floor floor system. It has limit switches at every floor and 4 buttons at every floor to control the direction of the dumbwaiter. An lcd display will be at floor 1 that displays the floor and direction of the dumbwaiter. FLoors 2 and 3 need two limit switches each to prevent overshoot and floors 1 and 4 need only one limit switch each. This is not currently in the code. The current code does not work properly. It starts the motor on floor 4 and when the button is pressed to floor 1 the motor goes down to it but when floor 1 switch is closed the motor does not stop it switches directions.
